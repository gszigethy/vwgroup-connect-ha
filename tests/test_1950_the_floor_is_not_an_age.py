"""#1950 — three comments called the dataset-level capture time a "~15-min
floor", and that wording reached a reporter as an answer.

The parser was always right; only the prose about it was wrong. Prose cannot be
regression-tested by reading it, so this module pins the properties the
corrected comments now assert, and guards the phrase itself.

Why it mattered beyond tidiness: @Adcad1970 asked when the closure and lock
sensors had last been captured, and the answer priced the floor at "roughly
fifteen minutes". It is not a duration at all. #1688 (@Datendieb) is the
standing counter-example in this repo: his export carried every data point at
16:59/17:00 while the car's own ``car_captured_*`` field sat five days earlier.
A floor read off that field is therefore neither an upper bound on age nor a
stand-in for the export's freshest reading.

The second thing pinned here was found by measuring rather than by reading. A
recorded capture time does NOT have to come from the leaf's own sibling key: a
``car_captured_*`` marker standing earlier in the SAME list becomes the capture
time of the items that follow it, on the assumption that VW groups a block of
points under one stamp. That assumption is an inference from POSITION, and the
repo's own #465 work plus @Adcad1970's two files of 30 Oct show VW reordering
the list between deliveries — so it is weaker than an entry's own timestamp, and
how common either shape is cannot be answered from this repo (four real export
files, all from one car, all with markers). What never happens is the
payload-wide floor being handed to a field in another branch. Those two routes
look alike in a single-marker file and are easy to conflate in a comment, which
is how the original wording got away with being wrong for so long.
