"""The indicator whose job is to report a frozen feed was itself frozen.

@Mex-ai11's Audi (#1851) served a snapshot nine days old while reporting
``data outdated: off``. Not why his data stopped — that is the manufacturer's
side — but why nobody was told.

``data_stale`` is computed in exactly one place, ``_enrich``, and ``_enrich``
only runs on a poll that parsed vehicle data. Every path that republishes the
previous snapshot instead carried the old verdict with it, and
``strip_runtime`` keeps every key without a leading underscore, so it reached
the on-disk store and came back on load. A *not stale* verdict decided while
the data was still fresh could therefore be saved, restored, and held through
every empty read afterwards — indefinitely (#1920).

The fix re-decides the verdict wherever a snapshot is republished. That needs
no fresh poll: the capture stamp is carried forward, so the age is knowable,
and a republished snapshot gets a verdict that is true *now* rather than true
when it was last read.

**No "values moved" exemption on a republish.** That exemption (#1688) exists
because a stamp can read old while readings change underneath it. On a
republish nothing has changed by definition, so applying it would answer "is
this stale" with "it was not, last time".
