Pure-python ``adb-shell`` over TCP, so no ``adb`` binary is needed inside the
Home Assistant container. This is the only module that talks to the device, and
it is deliberately thin: everything that can be reasoned about without hardware
lives in ``screen.py`` and ``channel.py`` instead.

``adb-shell`` is imported lazily inside the methods, so importing this module
