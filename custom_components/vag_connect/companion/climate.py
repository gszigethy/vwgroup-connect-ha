"""Volkswagen Air Conditioning sheet: state and commands for the companion channel.

Builds on the channel's walk, overlay, version and rate-limit machinery; this
module only knows the one sheet behind the overview's ``climateTile``.

What the app does, from the installed 4.3.2 APK and the #968 captures:

* ``cta_start`` / ``cta_stop`` is one button whose resource-id flips while air
  conditioning OR window heating runs. The sheet dismisses itself once the app
  has had its start/stop request accepted.
* The Mk8 toggles (``air_conditioning_toggle`` / ``window_heating_toggle``) and
  the mode picker (``clima_air_conditioning_pick`` → "Select mode") only choose
  WHAT Start starts. Changing them sends nothing to the car.
* The temperature dial is a pager of 15.5 (LO) … 30.0 (HI) °C in 0.5 steps;
  the app has no Fahrenheit dial (ClimaSettingsMapper sends "celsius").
  Tapping a neighbouring number scrolls one step; the app sends the new target
  to the car 1 s after the dial stops (debounced), idle or running, and on
  close. So a temperature change costs one car request of its own: the taps
  go out in one batch inside the debounce, and the dial is read back once.
  In the window-heating mode the dial is drawn but disabled.
* Labels are matched against the installed app's own translations
  (``resources.py``); the German/English patterns are only the fallback when
  the tables cannot be read.

The sheet has no Save (4.6.4 review): Start applies the selected mode and the
dial's temperature. So the mode and temperature are held in HA and applied by
``start`` itself, right before it presses Start; changing them alone never
opens the app.

Every step is read back from the screen before the next one, and a command
never confirms anything the app did not show. A tap is not a vehicle result:
the next poll supplies the real state.
