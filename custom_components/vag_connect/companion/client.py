"""Companion (ADB) client adapter — v3.0.0-alpha.

Presents the same duck-typed surface the coordinator already expects from a
CARIAD client (``authenticate`` / ``get_vehicles`` / ``get_status`` /
``command_*``), so the companion channel slots in as just another source with
no special-casing in the poll loop. The token/portal/MBB attributes the
coordinator touches via ``getattr(..., default)`` simply are not here, so those
paths fall through cleanly.

There is no network login: the "auth" is the phone already being signed into the
app. ``get_vehicles`` returns the single VIN the user entered at setup, because
this channel reads one phone showing one account's car.
