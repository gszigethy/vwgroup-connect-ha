"""Companion channel orchestration — v3.0.0-alpha.

Ties the transport and the screen parser to a brand preset, and adds the two
safety layers that keep this from misbehaving against the car:

- **Failure cooldown.** After a transport failure the channel backs off for a
  fixed window instead of retrying every poll, so a phone that is asleep or off
  the network does not turn into a per-poll error storm. Read cadence in the
  healthy case is simply the coordinator's ``scan_interval`` — a uiautomator
  dump reads the LOCAL screen and generates no manufacturer-backend traffic of
  its own, so there is no abuse argument for a second, private read budget on
  top of the interval the user already controls.
- **Write quarantine.** Writes require a verified preset AND a live app version
  that matches the one the preset was built against. A version drift disables
  writes but leaves reads running, because a stale tap map is how you tap the
  wrong control on a real car.

The cooldown clock is injected (``time_fn``) so the whole thing is testable
without sleeping or touching a device.
